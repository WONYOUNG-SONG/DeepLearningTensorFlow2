# Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2: Self-Study Repository

Welcome to my self-study repository for learning Deep Learning using **TensorFlow 2**. 
This repository is based on the resource,[DeepLearningZeroToAll](https://github.com/hunkim/DeepLearningZeroToAll) 
and serves as a hands-on journey through fundamental and advanced deep learning concepts.

## Overview

This repository contains:
- **Code implementations** of key concepts in Deep Learning using TensorFlow 2.
- **Exercises and tutorials** inspired by [DeepLearningZeroToAll](https://github.com/hunkim/DeepLearningZeroToAll).
- **Experiment results** and **visualizations** of various deep learning models.

## Key Topics Covered
- Neural Networks from Scratch
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Training and optimization techniques
- Overfitting and Regularization
- Transfer Learning

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Jupyter (optional, for running the notebooks)
